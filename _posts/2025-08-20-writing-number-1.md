I have always been meaning to write for a while now. there are many times i just feel the urge to write something but very unclear on what to write. i think am just going to being today and write my mind. I intend to get some clarity through my writing on the many subjects and if possible connect these dots for something bigger. not absolutely sure if this is going to be useful or productive for me or anyone seeing this. but what the heck, lets do it


Villans or the so called antagonists have always instilled curiosity in me. the other day there was an animated movie on indian mythology i was watching where the Asura or the rakshasa or the villian of the story keeps proclaiming they are the bad folk and they want to do bad things to the world. just like any other human i have a grey shade to me. there are times i feel the urge to do or say something bad about others. but during the moment i never feel whatver am doing or saying is bad. or do I?? hmmm…..let me think. Actually I thought about it abit, I dont think I do…at that particular moment. But immediately after I do realize that I have said or done something deragotary. The concept of bad is very subjective, just like Thanos never thinks wiping out half the world is bad, you never think whatever you do or say in the moment is bad. And if that moment tends to stay longer (maybe forever) then there is no way you see it from another perspective and that becomes your resting state and the truth you live by. So I dont think any Asura if they ever existed has ever thought they are the bad guys. They must be knowing they are doing something harmful for others but they do have their reasons. For a few, it just might be that they are ambitiious and they dont care about what comes their way. When Ravana kdinapped Sita, he definitely had his reason. Its the deep love he shared for his sister or maybe he is too proud of his reputation and just believes no can can or should ever touch him. and he definitely stood by it and did whatever it takes for others to realize that.

I have had this debate with my mom a few years back that there is nothing called bad in this world and it is very subjective. Am not sure I completely agree with then-me anymore. just listing out scenarios where its actually not subjective. people do say killing others is bad or something thats harmful physcially or inflict pain physcially or mentally is bad. but dont we rejoice when India wins a war over Pakistan, and its not just the soldiers but there is a lot of collateral damage no one ever cares or talks about. the same with the war of Ramayana. why did the poor soldiers ever have to be cut down on their life figting by the side of Ravana or even Rama. thats inflicting pain just in the name of Dharma or the necessity that good needs to win over bad.

Coming back I think we all oscillate between what we believe and want. and everytime that changes our realizations change. we keep feeling good or bad what we were or did moments before. Should we not oscillate and just believe or want in one thing and stick to it. is that the absolute truth everyone talks about of achieveing through deep meditation and siddhi. But that wouldn’t keep us up with the world which just constantly changes. what about the other extreme though, i think that would lead to lack of trust with the world and be perceived as someone who can’t stick to something and is gullible.  what is the right thing to succeed? Success is for another day….probably. I think its somewhere in between, believe something but think deeply about it (only if its too important) and dont set them in stone but use a pencil on a paper, so you can see them, but always realize you might have to erase them and rewrite them.
